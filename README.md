(You'll need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to run the web app, and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the UI tests with [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase).)

#### This app was initially generated by:

```bash
npm install sails -g
sails new sails_demo_app --fast
```

#### â›µ To complete the setup, run:

```bash
npm install
```

#### â›µ To start the server, run:

```bash
node app.js
# - OR - #
sails lift
```

#### â›µ To view the website, go to: [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

(The app will stay up while the server is running.)

### Test Environment Setup / Running Tests

(In a separate terminal / command prompt.)

#### ðŸ”µ Go to the ``ui_tests/`` folder:

```bash
cd ui_tests/
```

#### ðŸ”µ Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Linux / macOS instructions
python3 -m venv sbase_env
source sbase_env/bin/activate

# Windows instructions
py -m venv sbase_env
call sbase_env\\Scripts\\activate
```

#### ðŸ”µ Install SeleniumBase + Chromedriver

```bash
pip install seleniumbase --upgrade
seleniumbase install chromedriver
```

#### ðŸ”µ Run the tests

```bash
pytest -v --rs --crumbs --dashboard
```

âœ… Here's what all those options do:

* ``-v`` : Display each test on a separate line.
* ``--rs`` : Reuse the browser session between tests.
* ``--crumbs`` : Clear cookies between tests using ``--rs``.
* ``--dashboard`` : Output test results to ``dashboard.html``.

### Sails Version info

This app was generated using Sails v1.4.0 on Jan 10, 2021.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@2.0.1`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v2.0.1/lib/core-generators/new). -->

This project's boilerplate is based on an expanded seed app provided by the [Sails core team](https://sailsjs.com/about) to make it easier for you to build on top of ready-made features like authentication, enrollment, email verification, and billing.

<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.)
